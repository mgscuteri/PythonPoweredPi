# PythonPoweredPi
I'm building a web app, and I'm hosting it all on Raspberry Pi's. Why? I don't know. Build first, ask questions later.  That's what I always say. 

Roadmap:  
☑ Python Static Content Server  
☑ Python Rest API Server  
☑ React Frontend  
☑ Host on Raspberry Pi 3  
☑ Implement Continuous Integration/Deployment  
☐ Make the front end pretty.  
☐ Add a proper database solution.  
☐ Implement Authentication/User Sessions  
☐ Integrage with DoorBell project (https://github.com/mgscuteri/DoorBell)
